The app integrates with stack exchange rather trying to create a question and answer network from scratch.  The M8Token ERC20 can incentivize user participation across all of stackoverflow.
There is a bounty factory contract that instantiates the mintable M8 token contract in its constructor function. The factory creates a new bounty contract instance when a user puts the bounty on a question. The factory instance model makes easy to manage bounty creation and related data. The architecture creates a separation of logic where the factory manages tokens and bounty creation but the bounty contains it's specific logic.
